                Iran's culture is very rich, civilized and Iran's historical
                cultural heritage is unparalleled in the world. Iranian people
                also remember their culture with awareness. As a historical
                country, Iran has seen empires such as the Achaemenid Empire in
                ancient times, and despite political, religious and historical
                changes, Iranians have maintained a deep connection with their
                past. Although daily life in modern Iran was mixed with Shia
                Islam, the country's native art, literature and architecture are
                reminders of its deep national tradition and a broader literary
                culture that spread across the Middle East and South Asia in
                earlier times. From a cultural point of view, most of Iran's
                modern history was devoted to the tension between Shia religion
                and Iranian cultural heritage.

                Despite the predominance of Persian culture, Iran is still known
                as a multi-ethnic country, and the Ler, Armenian, Azeri,
                Kurdish, Arab, Baluchi, Turkish, and other ethnicities, each
                have their own special literary and historical rituals, many of
                which date back centuries. For example, in the case of
                Armenians, these rituals date back to BC. These ethnic groups
                are often closely related to neighboring cultures outside of
                Iran.In total, the elements of Iranian culture that are beyond
                the political borders of Iran can be briefly listed as follows:
                1- Persian language and Persian dialects and dialects 2-
                National festivals including Nowruz and Yalda night and solar
                calendar 3- Philosophy 4- Zoroastrian religions and rituals 5-
                Iranian art (Persian literature and poetry, Iranian architecture
                and Iranian food) 6- Local cultures of Iranian peoples and 7-
                Traditional music of Iran.

                Iranshahr includes the geographical area and civilization area
                of the Iranian plateau and its adjacent plains, including Iran,
                a large part of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The historical
                use of Iran includes all the political borders of the country
                that was dominated by the Iranians, as well as the Middle River
                and most of Armenia and the South Caucasus.<span id="dots"

                  Hegel, the great German philosopher, considers Iranians to be
                  the first historical nation and the Iranian Empire as the
                  first empire in history. When talking about the history of
                  Iran, one should pay attention to whether it means the history
                  of the nations and peoples who have lived in the political
                  borders of today's Iran since the beginning of history, or the
                  history of the nations and peoples who call themselves Iranian
                  in some way and have lived in the geography that includes
                  today's Iran and the lands that historically have been a part
                  of Greater Iran (Iranshahr). Iran Sometimes the history of
                  Iran begins with the arrival of the Aryans, from whom the name
                  Iran is also derived, to the Iranian plateau; But this does
                  not mean that the plateau of Iran was uninhabited or
                  uncivilized before their arrival. Before the arrival of the
                  Aryans in the plateau of Iran, very ancient civilizations had
                  flourished and withered in this place, and some were still
                  flourishing. For example, the Nushijan civilization in Malair
                  Shahr Sokhte (in Sistan and Baluchistan), the civilization of
                  the inhabitants of Silk Hill (in Kashan), the Ilam
                  civilization (in the north of Khuzestan), the Minaian
                  civilization (in Bukan, Kurdistan and south of West
                  Azerbaijan), the Parsava civilization (in Piranshahr), the
                  Jiroft civilization (in Kerman), the Elipi kingdom (in
                  Kermanshah (the capital) and Kurdistan), the Lulubian
                  civilization (in Kermanshah (the capital), Kurdistan and
                  Azerbaijan), the Gutians (in Kurdistan, Kermanshah and
                  Azerbaijan). (Azerbaijan), Hasanlu Hill in South West
                  Azerbaijan, Ganj Dara Civilization (in Harsin, Kermanshah),
                  Ziviyeh Civilization (in Saqqez, Kurdistan), Goran Hill
                  Civilization (in Gilangarb, Kermanshah), Sheikhi Abad and Jani
                  Hill Civilization (in Dinur, Kermanshah), Godin Hill
                  Civilization (in Kangavar, Kermanshah), Ali Kash Hill in Ilam,

                  Rodan and then in Zagros), Tapours in Tabarstan (Mazandaran)
                  and... were in the land of Iran. Iran before history Main
                  articles: Iran before history and the chronology of Iranian
                  history from cave dwelling to the rise of the Achaemenids The
                  pre-historical period or pre-historic era is the period of
                  time before the recording of history or the invention of the
                  writing system. In this period, humans were not yet able to
                  record and report their lives and achievements, and human
                  experiences and achievements were quickly lost. During one
                  hundred and fifty years of archaeological excavations in Iran,
                  the prehistoric era of Iran has not been explored in the same
                  way; While extensive explorations have been done in the
                  western and southern regions, the northern and eastern regions
                  have remained relatively unexplored. The Paleolithic era has
                  been neglected. On the other hand, the Neolithic period has
                  been studied considerably in order to study the formation of a
                  succession. Little attention has been paid to the Early and
                  Middle Copper Age. However, the Late Copper Age has been well
                  studied in order to investigate the formation of the state.
                  The study of the Early Bronze Age also suffers from the same
                  heterogeneity. While the pre-Elamite period has been the
                  subject of interest in exploration, the Yanik culture in
                  northwestern Iran has been neglected. The urbanization process
                  and exchanges between regions have been investigated in the
                  Middle Bronze Age, but the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron
                  Age have not been investigated. The periods after that is the
                  period of the formation of the Median and Achaemenid states,
                  which has been studied a lot.</span
